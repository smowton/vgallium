This directory contains Python bindings to Gallium3D. It looks like a state
tracker from the pipe driver perspective, and it looks like a pipe driver from
the python script perspective.


To build you'll need:
* Python (with development packages)
* SCons
* SWIG
* Python Imaging Library with TK support (for the samples)

Invoke scons on the top dir as
 
 scons statetrackers=python

To use do

 export PYTHONPATH=build/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX/gallium/state_trackers/python

and then try running

  python src/gallium/state_trackers/python/samples/tri.py

which should show a triangle.


This is still work in progress:
- errors are not handled properly and almost always result in crash
- state atoms with array members are awkward to set
- there no efficient way to view images
