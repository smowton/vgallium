                             TRACE PIPE DRIVER


= About =

This directory contains a Gallium3D pipe driver which traces all incoming calls.


= Build Instructions =

To build, invoke scons on the top dir as
 
 scons statetrackers=mesa drivers=softpipe,i915simple,trace winsys=xlib


= Usage =

To use do

 ln -s libGL.so build/linux-x86-debug/gallium/winsys/xlib/libGL.so.1
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/build/linux-x86-debug/gallium/winsys/xlib

ensure the right libGL.so is being picked by doing

 ldd progs/trivial/tri 

and then try running

 GALLIUM_TRACE=tri.trace progs/trivial/tri

which should create a tri.trace file, which is an XML file. You can view copying 
trace.xsl to the same directory, and opening with a XSLT capable browser such as 
Firefox or Internet Explorer.


= Integrating =

You can integrate the trace pipe driver either inside the state tracker or the 
winsys. The procedure on both cases is the same. Let's assume you have a 
pipe_screen and a pipe_context pair obtained by the usual means (variable and 
function names are just for illustration purposes):

  real_screen = real_screen_create(...);
  
  real_context = real_context_create(...);
  
The trace screen and pipe_context is then created by doing

  trace_screen = trace_screen_create(real_screen);
  
  trace_context = trace_context_create(trace_screen, real_context);
  
You can then simply use trace_screen and trace_context instead of real_screen
and real_context.

Do not call trace_winsys_create. Simply pass trace_screen->winsys or 
trace_context->winsys in places you would pass winsys.

You can create as many contexts you wish. Just ensure that you don't mistake 
trace_screen with real_screen when creating them.
