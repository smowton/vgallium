/**
 * \file
 * Buffer fencing.
 * 
 * "Fenced buffers" is actually a misnomer. They should be referred as 
 * "fenceable buffers", i.e, buffers that can be fenced, but I couldn't find
 * the word "fenceable" in the dictionary.
 * 
 * A "fenced buffer" is a decorator around a normal buffer, which adds two 
 * special properties:
 * - the ability for the destruction to be delayed by a fence;
 * - reference counting.
 * 
 * Usually DMA buffers have a life-time that will extend the life-time of its 
 * handle. The end-of-life is dictated by the fence signalling. 
 * 
 * Between the handle's destruction, and the fence signalling, the buffer is 
 * stored in a fenced buffer list.
