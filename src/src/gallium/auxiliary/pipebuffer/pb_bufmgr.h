/**
 * \file
 * Buffer management.
 * 
 * A buffer manager does only one basic thing: it creates buffers. Actually,
 * "buffer factory" would probably a more accurate description.
 * 
 * You can chain buffer managers so that you can have a finer grained memory
 * management and pooling.
 * 
 * For example, for a simple batch buffer manager you would chain:
 * - the native buffer manager, which provides DMA memory from the graphics
 * memory space;
 * - the pool buffer manager, which keep around a pool of equally sized buffers
 * to avoid latency associated with the native buffer manager; 
 * - the fenced buffer manager, which will delay buffer destruction until the 
 * the moment the card finishing processing it.
